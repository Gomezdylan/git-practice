# Retro Hockey

## 🏒 Overview
Retro Hockey is a 2D top-down arcade hockey game built in Unity. Players skate, pass, shoot, and battle for puck control in fast-paced retro-style gameplay. The project includes custom physics, AI logic, shooting mechanics, collisions, sound effects, and polished camera work.

## 🎮 Features
- Smooth skating & player movement system  
- Passing and shooting (wrist shot + slap shot)  
- AI players with decision-making (move, pass, shoot)  
- Goalie mechanics and puck possession logic  
- StickLogic + Shot classes using inheritance & dynamic binding  
- Cinemachine camera shake  
- Goal horn, hit sounds, puck SFX, background music  
- Clean UI menus  
- Mac/Windows builds supported  

## 🧠 Technical Highlights
- `Movement.cs` handles acceleration, drag, and velocity  
- `Puck.cs` uses Rigidbody2D force-based physics  
- `WristShot` and `SlapShot` override the base `Shot` class  
- Offensive AI uses distance-to-goal & teammate evaluation  
- Dynamic binding example: `Execute()` in AI subclasses  
- Organized folder structure and custom scripts
